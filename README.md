Go through instructor video of explaining URL Validation testing. Explain testIsValid Function of UrlValidator test code. It is availabe under christia/UrlValidator folder. Give how many total number of urls it is testing. Also, explain how it is building all the urls. Give an example of valid url being tested and an invalid url being tested by testIsValid() method.  UrlValidator code is a direct copy paste of apache commons url validator code. The test file/code is also direct copy paste of apache commons test code. Do you think that a real world test (URL Validator's testIsValid() test in this case) is very different than the unit tests and card tests that we wrote (in terms of concepts & complexity)? Explain in few lines. Submit a file called ProjectPartA.txt with your writeup. You can submit the file under the folder URLValidator within on ONID directory. (How to setup this folder will be explained soon.)
