==============================
Title: Error validating 4 and 5 digit port numbers

Class: Logic Error

Date: 3/7/16
Reported By: Martin Stryffeler
Email: stryffem@oregonstate.edu


Product:    URL Validator
Platform:   Windows 8.1
Browser:    NA


Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
 When the URL Validator receives a URL with a port number that has four or five digits, it fails despite being
 a valid URL. This occurs every time a URL has a port number that is greater than 3 digits.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
String url = "http://www.google.com:33333";
UrlValidator validator =  new UrlValidator();
boolean test = validator.isValid(url);

Expected Results
----------------
test == true


Actual Results
--------------
test == false


Other Information
-----------------
The fault is located in UrlValidator.java at line 158. This is where the program splits the input string into the 
various elements that make up a URL. When the program gets the port number from the string, it only iterates up 
to three characters.
