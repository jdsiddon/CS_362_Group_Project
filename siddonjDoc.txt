==============================
Title: Url validator doesn't correctly identify an authority from a different country as valid.

Class: Logic Error

Date: 3/9/16

Email: siddonj@oregonstate.edu


Product:    URL Validator
Platform:   OSx                  Version: 10.11.3
Browser:    NA


Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
 When a top-level domain authority is entered other than the United States, the 
 urls are marked as invalid.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
String url = "http://www.google.ru";
UrlValidator validator =  new UrlValidator();
boolean urlValid = validator.isValid(url);

Expected Results
----------------
urlValid == true;


Actual Results
--------------
urlValid == false;


Workarounds
-----------
If you look in DomainValidator.java, the array of valid country codes (COUNTRY_CODE_TLDS)
only contains values up to Italy. Beyond Italy no other countries will return as a valid top level domain.
This should include all countries with a top level domain. The error is on line 357 because that is where the last
top level domain is included.

Other Information
-----------------
Localizing the bug with Agan's principles: I first began by observing url's in my test results that look like they should have passed
but were failing. Since I wasn't sure of the domain that was causing the fault I began to do an in depth review of the isValid()
method. This was using Agan's first rule "Understand the system under test". Next I used the "Make if Fail" principle 
and directly passed failing urls into the isValid() method, that way I was sure it was isValid creating the error and not
something in our test suite. None of my results where change by passing urls directly into isValid so that means
there is a bug in isValid. Next I removed invalid input domain's one at a time until I only had 'valid' input domains (every url
I generated should pass). This was Agan's 5 principle, "Change one thing at a time". This allowed me to fully localize
the input domain causing the fault, the url authority. I then returned to Agan's first rule to ensure I understood how 
the authority was validated with my urls that were failing. Stepping through the isValid code line by line lead me to 
COUNTRY_CODE_TLDS array of strings being used to validate the top level domain. Since the url "google.ru" was failing I looked
to see if it did contain the "ru" top level domain. It didn't, which caused isValid()'s call to isValidTld() to return
false, making the url invalid.
